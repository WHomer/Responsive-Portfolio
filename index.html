					<p>Hello my name is William Homer and my passion is creating useful things.  I enjoy learning and expanding my skill set while increasing the number of tools on my belt. Making connections with amazing talented people is a great experience and with that there is nothing better than the world of development.</p>

						<h2>Early Years</h2>
						<p>Born in April of 1990 I had the experience of growing through the modern technological breakthrough that has led our world into the digital age from ordering a car service from your phone to sending payments in sercure fashions using blockchain technology. Born and raised in the Suburbs of Chicago, ILL I graduated High School in Spring of 2008 and set my sights onto a local community college and started to work full time.</p>

					<p>Hello my name is William Homer and I'm currently learning to become a full stack JavaScript web developer.</p>
					<p>I'm currently working towards my undergrad in computer programming online attending Champlain College based in Burlington VT.</p>
					<p>I enjoy following larger companies to see new software or products that they are releasing or working on.  A few of these companies are Apple, Amazon and Google (Alphabet).</p>
					<p>I've spend the last eight years of my life torn between an operational lifestyle and IT projects.  It appears that these are, at least for my current company, merging into one as sales is driving operations for a better product and service and that drives operations to demand applications from IT.</p>
					<p>This is what drives me. To find the current way something is done, find the bottle knecks, address incomming sales and then work towards a solution through the use of modular applications</p><p>I've grown up north of Chicago and have lived in the surronding suburbs for the majority of life.  I currently live in a small town called Island Lake with my dog Ace. My immediate family lives in the area with my sister and brother both living in the same town.</p>
